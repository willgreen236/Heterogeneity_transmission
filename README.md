# Heterogeneity_transmission

This repository contains the code and data pertaining to the paper 'Inferring the reproduction number using the renewal equation in heterogeneous epidemics'.

The code contains four types of function:
- Functions to generate generation time distributions (as per equations 8, 9 and 10)
- Functions to generate mixing- and relative risk- matrices (equation 7)
- Functions to infer R given a set of generation time distributions, a relative risk matrix and a growth rate (equation 6)
- Plotting functions for visualising outputs

The functions are described within the R file, with reference to the paper where appropriate.
